# Super Happy Fun Time Project :) Woo!

<h2> What is this? </h2>

This project focuses doesn't really focus on anything. It's a (hopefully) organized website full of React and CSS experiments.

The original goal was to make some sort of photo organizer. This was inspired by the nightmare that is Google Photos and especially Apple Photos. I use inspired looslely, because nothing of that original project currently exists. Now there are some remnants of it left, but the original uploader and organization has been repurposed for wacky ideas.

Now there's a few more goals. Check branches for incomplete work/ spilt can's of gobbledygook and whachamacallits.

Yeah... This is an informal personal project.

I try to keep my skills from dulling (especially my CSS). I enjoy precise and reliable documentation that screams "final product", so there can be a few hundred commits but very little actual progress. I do this to blow off steam after a stressful week or when I'm bored. (I also like enjoy bad jokes)
