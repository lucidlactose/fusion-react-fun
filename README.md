# Super Happy Fun Time Project :) Woo!

<h2> What is this? </h2>

This project focuses on a sort of Photo Organizer. This was inspired by the nightmare that is Google Photos and especially Apple Photos. Personally I like using both albums and tags to find photos and most alternatives are just as horrid.

I personally use DigiKam, and while it's everything I ever wanted, I like making browser interfaces, so I'm making one inspired off DigiKam, image forums, and artsy-websites. I know what I want, I know what looks good, and I know how to do it. Use DigiKam, not this.


This is me having fun with web junk, primarily React and CSS (alot of CSS), to stay sharp. I don't recommend using any of this in any shape or form.

Yeah... This is both an informal personal project.

I enjoy precise and reliable documentation that screams "final product", so there's many revisions and commits that'll just be formatting/ design decisions.
I do this to blow off steam after a stressful week or when I'm bored. (I also like enjoy bad jokes)
